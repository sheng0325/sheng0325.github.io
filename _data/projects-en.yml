- name: PV Investment Analysis AI Agent
  year: '2025'
  tags: ERNIE Agent, FinTech, Data Analysis
  description:
    - Built an investment research decision-making agent on ERNIE Agent platform: constructed domain knowledge base and retrieval pipeline (chunking/metadata/recall + reranking), supporting traceable citations of policy/re reports.
    - Toolized valuation and metric calculations: designed DCF/cash flow engine (including tax parameters like "three-year exemption and three-year halving" and multi-scenario parameters), constraining parameters and unit standards through Tool Schema, driving deterministic calculations via Tool/Function Calling.
    - Designed governance for "computational hallucinations/logical discontinuities": structured output templates + parameter validation/exception fallback/clarification query mechanisms; outputs IRR, LCOE, and key intermediate items, achieving an interpretable closed loop.
